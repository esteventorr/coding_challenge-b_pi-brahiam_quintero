## Introduction
Human üßë‚Äçüíª: how can I get started developing a react app using TDD?

Chat-GPT ü§ñ: To get started with developing a React app using TDD (Test-Driven Development), you can follow these steps:

Set up your development environment: Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and a code editor installed on your computer.

Create a new React project: Use the create-react-app command line tool to quickly create a new React project with a basic file structure.

Choose a testing library: There are several popular testing libraries for React, including Jest, Mocha, and Enzyme. Choose one that you are familiar with or that you would like to learn.

Write tests: Write tests for the components and features of your React app before you write any code. This will help you understand the requirements and design of your app before you start coding.

Write code: Write the code for your React components and features, making sure that they pass the tests you wrote in step 4.

Refactor code: Refactor your code as necessary to make it more maintainable and efficient.

Repeat: Continue this process of writing tests, writing code, and refactoring until your React app is complete.

It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the basics of React and TDD before you start, so make sure to read some tutorials or take an online course if needed.

###Trusting the AI:

### Technical Notes:
- **src/utils/utilVars.js** has a class where you can enable or disable the **Mock Mode**, enabling it will manage the Data on the Local Storage. it's useful when the Server is offline.
